# count_tag_fb_friend
ignore all html and css..just find logInWithFacebook() and then postToFeed() methods and their flow. You will find count for tags
# you will need to create the facebook app to use app id in this code.
# whole code is in javascript
# i have used PHP variables to get contents (image ,link etc) dynamically.
# it is basically 2 step process
1) you need to login, find logInWithFacebook() method which is on click of "Sign Up With Facebook"
   - when clicked on this text , user will be asked to login. 
   - when login is completed then step 2 div will be shown
2) you need to find postToFeed() method .

  - here user can share the post.
  - read these two methods carefully. you will easily understand the login
  - if not, comment .. i will surely update the file.
